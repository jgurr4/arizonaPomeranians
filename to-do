Nitpicky things to fix or to make sure to change when making a new website:


-When at smallest size, there is a bar on right side that won't go away, try to get rid of it somehow.
-Stop pics and header from resizing with rem/em. Make them have fixed widths based on @media queries.
-Make one more size smaller at which point the left nav be a hidden menu that can popup with a click now. And make the aside disappear as well, this way there is more space for main to be seen. 
-Stop the horizontal scroll causing the nav to follow along, or just stop it from sticking when scrolling page left-right.
-Make size of words in main be more comparable to size of main when it gets resized.
-Get arrows to work in cycling through pictures.
-6: Try to think of cool things you can add to the site to show off some programming talent, such as adding more javascript, or moving pictures, or something.
-5: Mom would like at least 1 or two moving pictures(gifs) of the dogs. She will send you the assets for this.
-4: Fix issue of clicking on link box not actually registering click unless you click on actual letters. Make it so when you click anywhere in the box it will send people to the other webpages.
-3: consider having a border around pictures when in zoom-in mode.
-2: swap buttercup pic #1 on girls.html with number 5 or 6. 
-1: Make "Charmin" picture not enlarge when clicked.
0: Either make main picture enlarge when clicked, or remove the hover icon which looks like it can enlarge.
1: fix the pictures index page from having uneven space on both sides when resizing.
2: Consider adding arrows to switch between pictures when zoomed in.
4: Fix issue with giant border on main pic when in small screen mode.
5: fix pics on Girls page to make it not resize pics when resize window, instead set a default size and make it only change when the size gets too small for the picture to be visible anymore.
6: Make the nav size and text only change at set amounts, not with vw or rem, because it's better to make sure that the words do not wrap between words.
7: Try making different backgrounds and borders to make each page unique and different from each other.
8: might be nice to try changing background affect from resizing main pictures/content so they change percentage when screen size is smaller just so they can take more space inside the main section width-wise, because they shouldn't just take 45% of width, and leave 65% outside that isn't used, if they need the width. Only reason for 45% is to be their max width when in larger screen modes, because if not they would stretch out and look funny.
