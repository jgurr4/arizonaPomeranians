#1: Make a minimum font size for phones

Deploying to Server:
 - Figure out how to make backup.sql file from existing azpom database.
 - Fix the bug with mariadb/wikijs, and portfolio/med_dissector (read the logs I captured in a file on the server)
 - Use rsync to copy the backup.sql file into ~/sql-scripts/ on the server
 - go inside the mariadb container and import the backup.sql as well as the server.sql files.
